            <h2>Development of wide area networking</h2>
            <p>
                The earliest computers were initially directly connected to terminals which users would use. During 1950s Wide area network(WAN) emerged, connecting multiple computers in the same building/site. Though it was only established during the 1960s.
                The idea for the internet came from J. C. R Licklider who got the inspired from another computer advancement, the Time-Sharing (Multitasking) developed by Christopher Strachey.
                J. C. R Licklider with Jack Ruina 1960 established the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The purpose of the IPTO was to interconnect the United States Department of Defense's main computers at Cheyenne Mountain, the Pentagon, and SAC HQ.

            <h2>Development of packet switching</h2>
            <p>
                The first step of creating the internet was to connect two separate physical networks to create one logical network.
                Early networks used message switching systems that required rigid routing structures that was prone to single point failure.
                Donald Davies developed the first local area network (LAN) based on packet switching. Larry Roberts then added the packet switching technology to the ARPANET WAN.
                Leonard Kleinrock later developed the mathematical theory behind the performance of packet switching building on his earlier work on queueing theory.

            <h2>Software</h2>
            <p>
                A software was developed in C called Network Control Program (NCP).
                This software was further developed by Robert E. Kehn and Vint Cerf to formulate Transmission Control Program (TCP).
                During this time the term catenet (concatenated network) was coined and internet as a contraction of internetworking.
                The software was later installed in the ARPANET.

            <h2>NPL network</h2>
            <p>
                Donald Davies became interested in data communications for computer networks after he had a discussion with J. C. R. Lickider.
                1966 Davies designed and proposed a national data network based on packet switching. The following year he described the use of an “Interface computer” to act as a router.
                He also produced a design for a LAN to serve the needs of National Physical Laboratory. Donald Davies and his team were the first to use the term “protocol” in data-communication context.
                Year 1969 Davies started to build the mk1 packet-switched network that would meet the demand of the multidisciplinary laboratory.
                This would also prove that this technology was in operational condition.
                When the NLP network was completed there were two networking the world to use packet switching. The NLP team started to use the network for simulations,
                datagrams and research to carrie on with internetworking or as we know it internet.

            <h2>ARPANET</h2>
            <p>
                The IPTO had installed three network terminals for System Development Corporation in Santa Monica,
                Project Genie at University of California and Compatible Time-Sharing System project at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
                For Robert Taylor identified the need for networking became obvious from the wast of the resources.
                He thought why have tree terminals if you can instead have one terminal for all the connections.
                That idea created “ARPA net”. Robert Taylor with Larry Roberts from MIT created a project to build such network.
                During the project Robert proposed a idea that came from Wesley Clark for using Interface Message Processors to create a message switching network.
                Roger Scantlebury presented Donald Davies' work on packet switching for data communications and mentioned the work of Paul Baran at RAND.
                Roberts implemented the different technology presented by Roger Scantlebury.
                1 January 1983 ARPANET change protocol from Network Control Protocol to TCP/IP protocols, marking the start of the modern Internet.

            <h2>Merit Network</h2>
            <p>
                Merit Network was formed 1966 to explore computer networking and as means to help educational and economic development.
                It got support from State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation.
                They connected multiple computers form different location in addition they enhanced the support for terminals to host connects like remote printing, file transfer and more.
                This was the gateway for Tymnet and Telenet (Telenet still exist).
                Later TCP/IP was implement to the network and more University were added. This set the stage for Merit’s role in NSFNET project starting in the mid-1980s.

            <h2>CYCLADES</h2>
            <p>
                The CYCLADES packet switching network was a French research network designed and directed by Louis Pouzin.
                First demonstrated in 1973, it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design and to support internetworking research.
                It was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself,
                using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms.
                Concepts of this network influenced later ARPANET architecture.

            <h2>UUCP and Usenet</h2>
            <p>
                In 1979 two students name Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, came up with an idea of using Bourn shell scripts to transfer news and messages on serial lines.
                When the software was released in 1980, the network on the serial lines expanded.
                It spread fast because of the low costs to be involved and the lack of strict use policies compared to other networks.
                Another reason was that it could use other existing lines like ARPANET.

            <h2>TCP/IP</h2>
            <p>
                With so many different network methods, something was needed to unify them.
                There for Bob Kahn of DARPA recruited Vinton Cerf to work with him on the problem.
                Steve Crocker formed an ARPA “Networking Working Group” with Vint Cerf. The working group became international in 1972.
                The group worked out a fundamental reformulation, where the differences between network protocols were hiddan by using a common internetwork protocol.
                Another addition they made the host responsible for the reliability of the packages then the network as in the CYCLADES network.
                The new protocol was named Transmission Control Program (TCP).
                They also split TCP/IP in two different layers as which resulted to IP protocol and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
                It was published 1977.

            <h2>From ARPANET to NSFNET to Modern Internet</h2>
            <p>
                After the ARPANET had been up and running for several years, ARPA looked for another agency to hand off the network to.
                ARPAs primary mission was to fund cutting edge research and development not to run a communication utility.
                Another reason was that the networks based on the ARPANET were government funded and therefore restricted to noncommercial uses such as research.
                In 1986 the NSF created NSFNET to support NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers but it was also left open for normal users.
                The network quickly became overloaded and was upgraded  under a cooperative agreement with the Merit Network, IBM, MCI and the State of Michigan.
                The existence of NSFNET allowed the ARPANET to be decommissioned in 1990.
                Later NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995 when it was replaced by commercial internet service providers.

            <p>
                In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed for “a large hypertext database with typed links”.
                Although attracted little interest. But his boss Mike Sendall encouraged him to developed it anyways.
                Later Tim Berners-Lee found support from Robert Cailliau.
                By Christmas 1990 Berners-Lee had developed and build all the tools necessary for a working Web:
                the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the HyperText Markup Language (HTML),
                the first Web browser (named WorldWideWeb, which was also a Web editor),
                the first HTTP server software, the first web server, and the first Web pages that described the project itself.
                The browser could also access Usenet newsgroups and FTP files.
                It was later developed further by other parties to the www as we know it today.
